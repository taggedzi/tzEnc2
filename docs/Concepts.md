# Concepts

## **Core Encryption Principles**

> tzEnc2 employs a grid/time-based mapping to disperse plaintext across a grid structure, increasing resistance to some attacks via redundance and positional noise.

## **Redundance Explained**

> Redundance is the minimum number of times each character (or byte) is mapped within the encrypted data. Higher redundance increases computational cost for attackers but also increases resource use.

## **Grid/Time-Based Scheme**

> Unlike traditional block or stream ciphers, tzEnc2 arranges data on a multi-dimensional grid and shifts data across “time” or “rounds,” inspired by physical systems and cellular automata.
