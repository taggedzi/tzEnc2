# Introduction

**What is tzEnc2?**

> tzEnc2 is an experimental Python encryption tool that uses a unique grid/time-based scheme for encrypting data. Its goal is to provide a novel approach to data protection, exploring ways to enhance security through increased data redundance and variable grid patterns.

**Key Features:**

* Configurable “redundance” level for noise and complexity
* Grid/time-based encryption mapping
* Message integrity with optional HMAC
* Python library and CLI tool

**Project Status / Roadmap:**

> *Alpha: Under review, seeking feedback from cryptographers and security experts. See Roadmap for planned improvements.*

**Multilingual Support:**

This project is designed to work with as much of the UTF-8 character set as possible (not all). It should be compatible with most languages or character sets.
As a side note the more languages you use in your data, the larger the dataset will need to be before it can be encrypted, causing larger computational costs (for you and attackers).
